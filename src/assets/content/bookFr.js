         I was deeply entrenched in my role as a sound and lighting engineer at the bustling Melbourne Convention Center.
         Amidst the vibrant hum of events and performances, I hardly had a moment to contemplate the world of programming.
         However, my friend Aron from Australia often mentioned that understanding the fundamentals of coding was a valuable skill for everyone.
         His words sparked a curiosity within me, and though I couldn't dive into it at the time, the idea lingered.`,

         My wife, a Sri Lankan citizen whom I had met during my volunteering stint as a school teacher in Vietnam, and I embarked on an ambitious hotel project in Sri Lanka.
        The prospect of a new beginning beckoned, with our project aimed at contributing to the hospitality industry on this picturesque island.
        As we poured our hearts and resources into the project, the world was suddenly struck by the unprecedented COVID-19 pandemic.
        Our dreams were put on hold as the tourism industry ground to a halt.
        With ample time on my hands and the need to reforge a long-term goal, a new direction for my professional career began to take shape.`,

         text:`It was at this pivotal moment that the words of Aron resurfaced in my memory.
         I realized that the time had come to give coding a shot, with nothing to lose and everything to gain.
         My journey of transformation commenced as I delved into the realms of programming, plunging headfirst into languages like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
         I was captivated. Within just one week, I was utterly hooked. The beauty of code's logic and the endless possibilities it offered drew me in, like an enchanting puzzle waiting to be solved.
         Determined to master the craft, I embarked on a six-month course to comprehend the core principles, algorithms, and object-oriented languages that form the foundation of the coding world.`,

      The goal was evident - I wanted to evolve into a full-stack engineer, with a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end development.
      Armed with unwavering determination, I journeyed forward.
      Since then, my coding endeavors have grown by leaps and bounds.
      With the support of vacation home owners, I developed a desktop application that simplified their management of bookings and client databases.
      The pursuit of knowledge was unrelenting.
      I earned certificates in front-end web development and undertook numerous personal projects, which you can explore on my projects page.
      I now stand fully dedicated to designing and developing applications that empower projects and make a positive difference in the world.`,
